## About

This is a beginner-friendly Python script where the user is asked to enter a name. If the name matches "Girish", it reveals some cool personal details. Otherwise, it shows an error-style message.

## How It Works

- Takes user input via `input()`
- Converts it to lowercase using `name.lower()`
- Checks if it matches "girish"
- If it matches, prints an introduction
- If not, prints a rejection message
